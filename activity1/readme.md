## Problem Description:
- [SPOJ Automata - GAME2](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AUTOMATA/ "AUTOMATA - GAME2")

## Solution
I took a look on the problem and noticed that it's a LR (regular language), that means can be represented by ER (expression regular).
So, I tried represent the language special characters ( __*__ and **?** ) in a regular expression for use in regular expression processor, eg. GREP.
After that, all becomes natural, I took a look for a regular expression library for python (**RE**) and understand how to use.
